# NSMB-Practice-Hack
This is a patch for New Super Mario Bros. for the DS made by willyjohn1 (Will)
This patch has edits to many levels with the purpose of practicing speedrun tech and tricks in a more efficient way than an unmodified ROM.
This README includes a list of the edits and then further down is some info on how to use a patch file if you need it and a note about save files.

Edits Made:
  > 8-2: A 2nd and 3rd pipe has been added to the start area that leads straight to the barrel room (fast 8-2 room) and the last room (fast skeet room) respectively. This is for fast 8-2 practice or even barrel jump practice and then also for fast skeet practice.
  > 8-T: A door has been added to the beginning which takes you to the bowser Jr. fight. This is for quick kill practice.
  > 8-3: A 2nd pipe has been added to the start area that leads to the flagpole area. This is to practice the walljump off the pipe.
  > 8-C: A door has been added at the start that leads to the Dry Bowser fight. This is for practicing the jump onto the switch
  > 8-T2: A door has been added that leads straight to the Boswer Jr. fight.
  > 8-Bowser's Castle: A door has been added to the beginning that leads straight to the final boss room, this door is indicated by the flagpole. There is also a door in the place of the kill switch that leads you back to the start, so you can practice Bowser jump over and over. There has also been more doors added to take you to some individual rooms. The rooms are indicated by the number of circles above it; two circles takes you to room 2, three circles takes you to room 3, etc.
  > 6-1: This level has been turned into a firehops practice level
  > 5-B: This level has been turned into a level to practice hyperspeed and the successive frame perfect jumps
  > 7-Castle: I have added a door that leads to the boss fight and I have also added a door that leads to the area where the theorised skip starts
  > ALL CASTLES: A DOOR WAS ADDED TO THE START OF EVERY END CASTLE THAT TAKES YOU TO THE BOSS ROOM.

How to install the patch:
  > Using NSMB editor: Open a clean ROM in NSMB editor and then go to the "Tools/Options" tab and there you will find "Import Patch". You click that and select my patch file and it will patch it for you. Should only take a few seconds and once it is complete, you can close NSMB editor and the clean ROM you selected is now the Modified Practice ROM!
  > There is also Specialised Patching softwares out there such as xdelta. You can use these to patch the ROM as well.
 
 NOTE: The finished ROM will not include save info since save info is not stored in a .nds file. As you can see, there is a .sav file that you will download too, this is my personal save file that I dumped from my card, this save file does not contain any copyrighted or nintendo owned material so it's distribution is legal. This save file contains two 100% files, one with shell equipped and one with fire equipped.
 IN ORDER TO USE THE SAVE FILE, THE SAVE FILE MUST HAVE THE EXACT SAME NAME AS THE NDS FILE SO THAT YOUR FLASH CART WILL RECOGNISE TO USE THE SAVE.
 
Thanks for Downloading My ROM hack and I hope you find it useful!
