# NSMB-Practice-Hack
This is a patch for New Super Mario Bros. for the DS made by willyjohn1 (Will)
This patch has edits to many levels with the purpose of practicing speedrun tech and tricks in a more efficient way than an unmodified ROM.
This README includes a list of the edits and then further down is some info on how to use a patch file if you need it!

Edits Made:
  > 8-2: A 2nd pipe has been added to the start area that leads straight to the barrel room (fast 8-2 room). This is for fast 8-2 practice or even barrel jump practice.
  > 8-T: A door has been added to the beginning which takes you to the bowser Jr. fight. This is for quick kill practice.
  > 8-3: A 2nd pipe has been added to the start area that leads to the flagpole area. This is to practice the walljump off the pipe.
  > 8-C: A door has been added at the start that leads to the Dry Bowser fight. This is for practicing the jump onto the switch
  > 8-T2: A door has been added that leads straight to the Boswer Jr. fight.
  > 8-Bowser's Castle: A door has been added to the beginning that leads straight to the final boss room. There is also a door in the place of the kill switch that leads you back to the start, so you can practice Bowser jump over and over.
  > 6-1: This level has been turned into a firehops practice level
  > 5-B: This level has been turned into a level to practice hyperspeed and the successive frame perfect jumps
  > 7-Castle: I have added a door that leads to the boss fight and I have also added a door that leads to the area where the theorised skip starts

How to install the patch:
  > Using NSMB editor: Open a clean ROM in NSMB editor and then go to the "Tools/Options" tab and there you will find "Import Patch". You click that and select my patch file and it will patch it for you. Should only take a few seconds and once it is complete, you can close NSMB editor and the clean ROM you selected is now the Modified Practice ROM!
  > There is also Specialised Patching softwares out there such as xdelta. You can use these to patch the ROM as well.
